# Syracuse 311 Real-Time Service Request Analytics Pipeline
  
**Status:** Infrastructure Setup Complete

---

## 📋 Project Overview

An automated data analytics pipeline that processes Syracuse's 311 service request data to provide actionable insights for city officials, neighborhood associations, and residents. The system includes four advanced analytical capabilities: anomaly detection, predictive response time modeling, neighborhood comparison analysis, and seasonal pattern identification.

### Problem Statement

Syracuse receives thousands of 311 service requests annually for issues like potholes, trash collection, street signs, and more. Currently, this data is not systematically analyzed to:
- Detect unusual spikes in request volumes
- Predict resolution times for resource planning
- Compare service levels across neighborhoods
- Identify seasonal patterns for proactive maintenance

### Solution

A production-ready data pipeline that:
1. Automatically extracts data from Syracuse Open Data portal
2. Cleans and validates municipal data
3. Performs statistical and machine learning analysis
4. Visualizes insights in an interactive dashboard
5. Provides reproducible, documented analysis

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone [repo-url]
cd syracuse-311-analytics
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

**Fetch raw data:**
```bash
cd src/data_ingestion
python arcgis_api.py
```

This will:
- Connect to Syracuse Open Data API
- Fetch sample records
- Save raw data to `data/raw/`
- Generate metadata file

**Check the data:**
```bash
# View the CSV
cd ../../data/raw
cat sample_raw_data.csv

# View metadata
cat sample_raw_data_metadata.json
```

## 🔍 Data Quality Considerations

From initial exploration, we've identified these data quality issues to address in the cleaning pipeline:

1. **Date Format Issues:** `Created_at_local`, `Acknowledged_at_local`, `Closed_at_local` are strings requiring datetime parsing
2. **Type Inconsistencies:** `Minutes_to_Close` stored as string despite numeric content
3. **Missing Values:** Various fields have incomplete data
4. **Coordinate Validation:** Need to verify Lat/Lng values are within Syracuse bounds
5. **Duplicate Detection:** Check for duplicate request IDs

---

## 📝 Development Principles

- **Raw Data is Sacred:** Never modify original data; all transformations are documented
- **Reproducibility:** All analysis can be re-run from raw data
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear boundaries between ingestion, processing, and analysis
- **Documentation:** Code is well-commented; architectural decisions are recorded
- **Version Control:** Meaningful commit messages; feature branches for enhancements
- **Testing:** Critical calculations are validated against ground truth
