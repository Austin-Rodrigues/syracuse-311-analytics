Activity Summary (Dec 15-30):

During this reporting period, I completed foundational technical setup 
for the Syracuse 311 Real-Time Analytics Pipeline.

PROJECT SCOPING & PLANNING:
- Defined project scope: Building automated analytics pipeline for 
  Syracuse's 311 service request data with four technical enhancements
- Identified stakeholder groups: city operations managers, neighborhood 
  associations, budget analysts
- Established 9-week timeline with February 28 deadline
- Determined technical approach: raw data preservation with separate 
  processing layer

TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE:
- Set up professional GitHub repository with version control
- Implemented ArcGIS REST API client for Syracuse Open Data portal
- Successfully connected to SYRCityline dataset (50,000+ records, 2021-present)
- Extracted and validated 100 sample records
- Configured development environment: Python 3.11, pandas, libraries
- Established data governance: .gitignore prevents committing sensitive data

DATA DISCOVERY:
- Analyzed dataset schema: 19 fields including request ID, category, 
  timestamps, coordinates, response times, agency information
- Identified 5 data quality issues requiring pipeline handling
- Documented request categories and city agencies
- Confirmed data coverage: July 2021 - December 2024

ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:
- Adopted separation of concerns: distinct modules for ingestion, 
  processing, analysis
- Designed three-tier architecture: raw data (immutable), processed data, 
  feature engineering
- Planned ETL pipeline for reproducible transformations

STATUS: Technical foundation complete. Ready to begin data processing 
pipeline development in Week 2.

STEM Skills Refined:
- API integration with REST services (ArcGIS platform)
- Data architecture design: separation of concerns, layered processing
- Software engineering: version control, modular code, documentation
- Python programming: requests library, pandas, error handling
- Data quality assessment: schema validation, type analysis
- Project planning: stakeholder analysis, timeline development
- Data governance: raw data preservation, metadata tracking
- System design: ETL pipeline architecture, data flow planning
